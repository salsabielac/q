				<hr>
				If youâ€™re looking for peace and quiet, then Ubud is the place to be. Steeped in culture and enhanced by magnificent vistas, Ubud offers a respite from the humdrum of your busy life. In the past, Ubud was just a small village, but now it has grown into a thriving yet laid back cosmopolitan community. Ubud pampers visitors in body and soul. Fine dining restaurants and spas here will delight and relax the senses. A walk through the lush paddy fields, watching colourful processions of women gracefully balancing piles of fruit offerings on their way to the temple, are lasting impressions and simply breathtaking. Ubud is a perfect place for you to experience spiritual awakening and enlightenment. Visit Ubud to experience its peace and tranquility!
				<h3 class="bold">Get Arround</h3>
				Since Ubud is relatively small, you can explore the town on foot or hire a bicycle or motorbike. Bear in mind that as this is hilly terrain, so do ask locals first which places are easier explored on foot, by bicycle, motorbike or by car.
				<h3 class="bold">Get There</h3>
				Various modes of transport are available from all over Bali. If you decide to visit Ubud directly from the airport, you can hire prepaid cabs but the fee may be quite hefty. You can also take regular taxis or rental cars. Public transportation such as buses can also take you to Ubud.
